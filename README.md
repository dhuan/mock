*mock* is an API utility - it lets you:

- define API routes easily through API configuration files or through
  command-line parameters.
- use shells scripts as response handlers. Or any other type of program can act
  as response handlers.
- test your API - make assertions on whether an endpoint was requested.

## Getting started

Let's look at a simple example - an API with 2 routes `GET say_hi/{name}` and
`GET what_time_is_it`:

```sh
$ mock serve --port 3000 \
  --route 'say_hi/{name}' \
  --method GET \
  --response 'Hello, world! My name is ${name}.' \
  --route "what_time_is_it" \
  --method GET \
  --exec 'printf "Now it is %s" $(date +"%H:%M") | mock write'
```

Now try requesting your `mock API` at port 3000 (can also be from your
browser!):

```sh
$ curl localhost:3000/say_hi/john_doe

Hello, world! My name is john_doe.

$ curl localhost:3000/what_time_is_it

Now it is 22:00
```

*mock* lets you also extend other APIs (or any HTTP service, for that matter.)
Suppose you want to add a new route to an existing API running at
``example.com``:

```sh
$ mock serve --port 3000 \
  --base example.com \
  --route 'some_new_route' \
  --method GET \
  --exec 'printf "Hello, world!" | mock write' 
```

With the ``--base example.com`` option above, your *mock API* will act as proxy
to that other website, and extend it with an extra route `GET /some_new_route`.
Look up "Base APIs" in the docs for more details.

*[There are many other ways of further customising your APIs with *mock*. Read further through the guide to learn.](https://dhuan.github.io/mock)*
