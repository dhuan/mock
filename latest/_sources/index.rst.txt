mock - Language-agnostic API mocking and testing utility
========================================================

*mock* enables you to quickly set up HTTP servers for end-to-end tests.

-  Define endpoints and their respective responses through easy syntax;
-  Make assertions on…

   -  Whether a given endpoint was requested;
   -  If a JSON payload body was passed correctly to a given endpoint;
   -  If a header value was passed correctly;
   -  And other useful things…

.. code:: sh

   $ mock serve --port 3000 \
     --route 'say_hi/{name}' \
     --method GET \
     --response 'Hello world! My name is ${name}.' \
     --route "what_time_is_it" \
     --method GET \
     --exec 'printf "Now it is %s" $(date +"%H:%M") > $MOCK_RESPONSE_BODY'

Run the example command the above and try these URLs in your browser or
any preferred HTTP client: ``http://localhost:3000/say_hi/mock`` and
``http://localhost:3000/what_time_is_it``

*Why "language-agnostic"???* - similar tools exist out there but they somehow require you to write in some programming-language when setting up fake APIs for testing. *mock* on the other hand enables you to set things up easily by just writing configuration files.
