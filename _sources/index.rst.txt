Welcome to mock’s documentation!
================================

*mock* enables you to quickly set up HTTP servers for end-to-end tests.

-  Define endpoints and their respective responses through easy syntax;
-  Make assertions on…

   -  Whether a given endpoint was requested;
   -  If a JSON payload body was passed correctly to a given endpoint;
   -  If a header value was passed correctly;
   -  And other useful things…

.. code:: sh

   $ mock serve --port 3000 \
     --route 'time_in/{country}' \
     --method GET \
     --exec 'zdump ${country}' \
     --route 'whois/{domain}' \
     --method GET \
     --exec 'whois ${domain}'

Run the example command the above and try these URLs in your browser or
any preferred HTTP client: ``http://localhost:3000/time_in/Japan`` and
``http://localhost:3000/whois/google.com``
